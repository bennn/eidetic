benchmarks for space-efficient contracts

looking for programs where there's a significant amount of duplicate contracts
(hypothesis: the GT benchmarks are a great place to look)


For now, organizing benchmarks into categories:
- `rkt/` programs to run with & without space-efficient contracts
- `gt/` gradually typed programs; idea is, generate all configurations and then run with & without
