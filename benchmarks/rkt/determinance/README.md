determinance
===

Logic / Relational programming benchmark.

This benchmark runs extremely slower after 6.10.1,
 because of some commit that happened before:

```
  404539c894fe0b63323b222e3a5eb55fc6782f08
```

(The commit just after that one slowed down `fsmoo`; it's a rough time.)

The original program was part of some research about MiniKanren ... but I can't
figure out what. I don't even know what 'determinanace' means.
